#EncryptionSnake

This is a wrapper for OpenSSL code to make encryption easy enough for stupid people to be dangerous.
Use this as you please!


Currently supports:
<ul>
<li>SHA 256 hashing</li>
<li>AES 256 CBC encryption and decryption</li>
<li>RSA key generation to files.</li>
<li>RSA encryption and decryption</li>
</ul>

Up Next I'm gonna try and build out AES in CTR mode so that you can use AES for more secure network communication.
