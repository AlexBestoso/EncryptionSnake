#EncryptionSnake

This is a wrapper for OpenSSL code to make encryption easy enough for stupid people to be dangerous.
The code can without a doubt be made more clean; but, hey, It's free!
Use this as you please!


Currently supports:
<ul>
<li>SHA 256 hashing</li>
<li>AES 256 CBC encryption and decryption</li>
<li>AES 256 CTR encryption and decryption</li>
<li>RSA key generation to files</li>
<li>RSA encryption and decryption</li>
<li>Public and Private random byte generation</li>
<li>Base64 Encode and Decode</li>
</ul>
